While the idea of handing over important data to another company worries some people, cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources, because It transforms IT infrastructure into a utility, It eliminates the capital expense of setting up and running on-site data centers, and It makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive.
 

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. This new edge technology became a popular option for businesses for several reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security. One of the most known services provided using cloud technology is IAAS as mentioned in the research paper about the current trends and problems of cloud computing "From the perspective of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) customer, this paradigm shift presents both an opportunity and a risk. On the one hand, it provides developers with a simpliﬁed programming model for creating cloud applica-tions that abstracts away most, if not all, operational concerns;" (Baldini.I & Castro P && et al, 2017)
However, a lot of people are still quite cautious of cloud computing. They hear others talk about it and praise it, see them use it. But they still don’t want to leap themselves. And maybe they’re right, the cloud might not be the optimal solution for every business. It depends on the circumstances. But for most companies, the cloud can and will be helpful.
For instance, cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site data centers, the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. "Cloud  computing  involves  delivering  computing  resources  (e.g.  servers,  storages,  and applications) as services to end users by cloud computing service providers. End users access on-demand  cloud  services  through  web browsers.  Cloud  computing  service  providers  offer specific  cloud  services  and  ensure  the  quality  of  the  services.  Basically,  cloud  computing includes three layers: the system layer, the platform layer, and the application layer." (Te-Shun C, 2013)

Furthermore, most cloud computing services are provided self-service and on-demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.


With this in mind, companies that are deeper into the cloud are far less worried about downtime and much more likely to want to run more applications in the cloud. Hence,  security has always been a big concern with the new technology, especially when it comes to sensitive records and information. "Gap in Security in the cloud environment, customers cede control to the cloud provider; there is a related risk that the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will not adequately handle the responsibility of addressing security the way they are supposed to, or even that Service LevelAgreements (SLAs) do not include any provision of the necessary security services.This risk is dependent on the service model used in the cloud." (Ismaeel S & Asiri S, 2016), The good news is that regulations force cloud computing services to shore up their security and compliance measures which narrow down the data loss risks for the users.
