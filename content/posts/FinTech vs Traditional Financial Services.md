Getting into the Fintech industry without knowing the big picture of the financial system (History, crises, technology..) will be a huge waste for people's effectiveness and creativity while working on day to day problems. There’s a causality between the two concepts, thus this article will put the light on some important ideas with the emphasis of data emerging solutions.
In fact, data analytics capabilities in the financial industry seems like a good perspective to analyze the differences, the similarities and the correlation between Fintech and traditional financial services.


Isn’t Fintech, the digital transformation of Traditional financial services?

That was me asking this question 2 years ago while getting in more depth to the Fintech sphere. Therefore let's give some context to ensure a basic understanding of the main topic before going further with the big data inclusion.

The sense of financial technology refers to the non-financial institutions can reshape traditional financial products, services, and organizations by using mobile Internet, cloud computing, and big data (Bernardo, 2017). In other words, the application of technological innovation to optimize financial services. 

Traditional financial services, on the other hand, refer mainly to methods and models used by financial institutions to deliver the added value in terms of financial transaction. 

Going physically to a bank to make a deposit and transfer funds into your bank account through mobile applications are respectively examples of Traditional financial services and Fintech.

Sounds promising, doesn't it? And I would assume that anyone having these two options will prefer the app transaction than commuting physically to the bank. Unfortunately, It was so difficult to achieve this development level especially in a regulated sector such as financial services.

The complexity of reforming the financial services is clearly observed through the introduction of Fintech, back to the first transatlantic cable in 1866 (Barbiroli, 1997). Thus the discussion around the two concepts took so much time and resources to build up trust among users and change customers and decision makers cultures. But still some people in the financial industry regard the existence of fintech as a threat, while others see the rise of fintech as a challenge and an opportunity to improve the financial business.

There was an innovation to improve and predict future anomalies, but humans by nature are hardwired to resist change until it becomes a must. Global financial crisis contributed extensively to the radical changes that happened in the financial services. In 2008, with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in New York, the financial institutions of the world suffered a large-scale collapse and the global financial market began to turmoil. This financial crisis has worsened public opinion on financial institutions, banks, and financial services practitioners (Sumit, Gene, & Itzhak, 2014), on the other hand, it has brought fintech into the public’s perspective and enables financial professionals to find new and promising industries to use their skills (Mark & Terence , 2014).

Therefore, the fintech sector has developed rapidly over the past decade and is considered as one of the main disruptors of traditional financial services. Whether it’s to provide new ways to enhance the customer experience or improve the efficiency of financial institutions. Fintech actors came up with multiple solutions that reshaped the industry as a whole.

The revolution could be illustrated through graph 1 showing the consumer adoption of fintech companies and products which reflect the rapid growth worldwide between 2015 and 2019. In fact, passing from 18% to 75% in 4 years in terms of Money transfer and payments services seems phenomenal. The impact of technology in responding to customers' needs in comparison to the traditional procedures is obvious.

At this point, It becomes a matter of collaboration and competition between the fast growing startups in the fintech industry and traditional financial institutions. And this could be illustrated through the value of investment in the fintech companies graph 2 which reflect the investors behavior of taking a massive risk in a wide changing sector.

Collaboration or Competition - Big Data case study

Big data has now become a ubiquitous term, companies are starting to realize the importance of using more data in order to support decisions for their strategies. Big data is a generic term that designates the massive volume of data that is generated by increased use of digital tools and information systems (Sedkaoui, 2018).

Many companies became aware of the importance of data and invested heavily in building their infrastructure and processes (technology, training…) 

Therefore, what's the relationship with the financial industry?

The graph 3 showcases how fintech solutions related to data analytics capabilities ranked second in the strategic priorities for financial services organizations in 2020.

Collecting and analyzing data has become necessary to identify client segmentation, enhance security, improve risk assessment, processes automation…

Huge losses in the financial sector as of the 2008 financial crisis, Coronavirus pandemic is mostly due to the lack of information about the current situation, the bureaucracy in decision making and the implementation.

The traditional financial services are left behind by the competition. The growth started to rely on how likely the institutions will adapt to the current trends including the fintech solutions.  Fintech companies were mostly targeting financial institutions to restructure their business models and overcome their anomalies. Thus collaborations were built between the two actors. Of course other Fintech companies opted for the other side of the coin by launching products competing against the financial institutions that offer the most easy, fast and innovative financial services.

The comparison between Fintech and Traditional financial services remains a wide topic that has a limitless number of possibilities. My attempt to categorize them in the concepts of competition and collaboration in addition to my sub - topic of Data analytics capabilities emphasis on how important the collaborations between the two sectors would have a tremendous impact not only on customs benefits by making services more accessible and satisfying effectively their needs but also on companies profitability and competitiveness. 

Competition will remain existent following the natural behavior of the market and in my opinion Fintech solutions implemented in the global south where there’s no accessibility of financial services apart from big cities. Fintech becomes more handy in responding to customer needs, therefore a lucrative market that the traditional model will definitely struggle to get into.  For example The fintech ecosystem in Nigeria is largely comprised of businesses focused on mobile payments, digital banking, merchant solutions and personal finance, including wealthtech. 

To sum up, The monopoly in the financial sector is no longer feasible. Technology was able to develop everything in our life including financial services. Fintech actors become and most likely to cover a wide range of services, therefore Traditional actors need to develop collaboration options with this evolving industry otherwise the competition will be intensive starting with the traditional services that opted for the transformation to the fintech innovation that respond effectively to the customer needs. And as a response from my question that was stated in the beginning of the essay, Fintech can be part of the digital transformation strategies of the traditional financial services but it’s much wider than that, it could also be a unique and autonomous solution that substitutes the pre-existence financial services.
